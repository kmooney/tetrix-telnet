   [x] only send the line completion when the line status changes.
   [x] send board info along w/ line completion
[x] what is up with El and ElInv facing down?  Seems like they are causing display issues.
    - the issue was the representation of the El in the library code. it landed differently than 
    - the client expected, so the shape would go to 0,0 but the occupation matrix was off by one.
[x] there's a line clear bug - try and undersstand what's happening.
